### Notes
Part 1:
At first, I had trouble understanding RecyclerView, so I decided to watch more video before I started the project. When I finsih implementing the landscape mode, I didn't see the changes and thought something was wrong with my code, however, it was just some setting on the emulator that I needed to change.
